## 🌱 Introduction
**ForgedByFire** is my personal coding journey — a roadmap of projects and trials from **beginner** to **advanced** mastery in Python. This is not just a list of projects; it is a forge where coding skills, discipline, and spiritual reflection meld together.

Each project is treated as:
- 🔥 A **forge** to test and shape coding skills
- ⚔️ A **trial** that refines discipline, focus, and resilience
- ☪️ An **opportunity** to attach spiritual meaning (Qur’anic verse, Hadith, and a Soul-Ignition Quote)

## 🔥 The Plan
### 🐣 **Beginner Projects**
Small but crucial projects to learn the syntax, structure, and mindset.  
*(Example: Calculator, To-Do App, Hello World GUI.)*

### ⚔️ **Intermediate Projects**
Projects that deepen understanding and hone engineering skills.  
*(Example: REST APIs, Chat Applications, Simple ML Models.)*

### 👑 **Advanced Projects**
High-impact, highly challenging projects that force mastery across engineering, deployment, and AI/ML pipelines.  
*(Example: NLP Model Deployment, Self-Driving Simulation, Blockchain.)*

## ⚔️ Goal
To emerge from this forge:
✅ Strong in coding craftsmanship  
✅ Grounded in spiritual discipline  
✅ Prepared to create impactful projects that benefit both dunya and akhirah
