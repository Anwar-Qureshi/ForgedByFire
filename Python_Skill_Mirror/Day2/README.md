# ðŸ”’ Text Compressor - Day 2 (Run-Length Encoding)

## ðŸ’¡ Description

This is a Python program that compresses a string using **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** â€” a basic but effective compression technique.  
It converts repeating characters into a single character followed by its count.

Example:  
`aaaabbbccdaa` â†’ `a4b3c2d1a2`
